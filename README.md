# 🌍 My Travel Journal

My Travel Journal is a simple and responsive **React** application that displays travel destinations in a clean, card-based layout.  
Each entry includes an image, country, location name, travel dates, description, and a direct link to view the location on Google Maps.

This project focuses on **React fundamentals**, component reuse, and clean UI styling using **HTML and CSS**.

## 📸 Preview

The application displays a list of travel destinations such as:
- Mount Fuji (Japan)
- Sydney Opera House (Australia)
- Geirangerfjord (Norway)

Each destination is presented with an image on the left and detailed information on the right.

- The `App` component maps over the data and renders a `Card` component for each destination
- Props are used to pass destination details to each card
- The header is a separate reusable component
- Styling is handled entirely with CSS for layout and spacing
